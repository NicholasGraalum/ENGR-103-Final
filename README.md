# ENGR-103-Final
My final project for engineering 103, it is a simon says game based on an accelerometer for the ADAFruit Circuit Playground.
In this game you will be asked to choose a level, this is based on the buttons pressed, the right button is easy, left button is medium and both buttons is hard. 
You will have to match the sequence based on the accelerometer. Right, Left, Up and Down. 
When the right LEDS light up you will tilt the arduino to the right, left you tilt left, back LEDS means you tilt down, and front LEDS means you tilt up. 
Good Luck! And copy the sequence!
